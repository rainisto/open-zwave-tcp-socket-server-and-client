I forked this project from Thomas Loughlin (see the fork network).
When I started, the server was buggy and crashed all the time.
I decided to create a more stable and smarter server.

Please note that the PHP client is no longer updated.
I want to have a client with "live" data.
Websockets are ideal for this purpose.
The Websockets client is also depricated.
The functionality of websockets is now integrated in the Polymer Client.

Most of my latest work will be in the Test branch.
When merging the Test branch into Master, I want my server to be stable.

This project is running on my Odroid. A more powerful devboard created by Hardkernel.

Any comments or fixes are more than welcome.

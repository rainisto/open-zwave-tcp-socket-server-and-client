I forked this project from Thomas Loughlin (see the fork network).
When I started, the server was buggy and crashed all the time.
I decided to create a more stable and smarter server.

Most of my latest work will be in the Test branch.
When merging the Test branch into Master, I want my server to be stable.

This project is running on my Odroid. A more powerful devboard created by Hardkernel.

Any comments or fixes are more than welcome.
